          <p>Herold Frank is the owner and founder of Sapphire Clothing. Frank was a very talkative and friendly kid growing up, making lots of friends throughout his childhood and adulthood. To acknowledge the people he has met in his life, he decided to put them on clothes! This is where the idea for Sapphire Clothing came to action and Frank put his dreams to reality and created the clothing brand. He was finally able to launch the company on the 15th of March, 2010! The goal Sapphire wants to achieve is to show humanity that everyone is special in one way or another.</p>
          <p>Anthony Robinson is the manager at the store located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Anthony has been a big follower of Sapphire Clothing ever since we opened our first store in Sudbury, Ontario. He was first hired as a retailer for the store in Sudbury, he was one of the first employees ever here at Sapphire Clothing and we value him highly. Anthony put in a lot of work and helped grow our brand by spreading the word of about the new store at his high school, and with that we offered him the manager position at the store in Manitoba. He is know also studying business management at his local college while managing one of our current expansion stores.</p>
          <p>Francis Francis is the lead graphic designer and clothes marketer for Sapphire Clothing. Francis first joined the Sapphire Clothing team after graduating from his graphic design course at Carleton University at the start of summer 2019. Oddly, despite his outstanding skills in graphic design, Francis's first career path was to be a taekwondo teacher, as he loves the actor Jackie Chan and loves the movie Karate Kid. Taekwondo was a way for Francis to help people, by teaching them self defense and by encouraging fitness, and this love for helping people continues with our brand. Eventually he wanted to do more, so he revisited the talent he had in graphic design, its been his love and passion ever since.</p>
          <p>Igor Frank is the son of owner, Herold Frank. Igor was born in 2002 and is in his last year of high school. As his dad is nearing retirement and plans on giving Sapphire Clothing to Igor when he does so, Igor knows every thing and any thing there is about Sapphire. At the moment Igor has followed in his dad's footsteps and has done very well in school and has made a lot of friends. Igor currently works at the store in Sudbury, Ontario as a sales associate. After high school he plans on taking a commerce course at Laurentine University in Sudbury, to grow the business and expand worldwide.</p>
